## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Evan, a Ph.D. Research Engineer working on resource-constrained AI. 

I've been building stuff since I was 6. My first computer had 256 MB of RAM, and I used it to make a Visual Basic program that translated numbers into musical notes.

I've always felt like 256 MB was more than enough to do cool stuff. I've worked on secure autonomous satellites at the Air Force Research Labs, which ran GameCube-class processors. I earned a Ph.D. at UT Austin building private, [local AI models for smart devices](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11018738). While I was there I built [the first smart home powered by LLMs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3643505) in an unused electronics lab.

Now I'm at [Moonshine AI](https://github.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine), creating speech recognition, text-to-speech, and reasoning models that are still small enough to run on my first computer.
